# Hello! My name is Ben McFarland <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a software developer from the greater Portland, OR area. I have been using code and learning computers since middle school. I am familiar with HTML/CSS, JavaScript/React, and C#/.NET. And I have experience with C++ and Python. I am very detail driven when I code, and love problem solving. I'm always trying to expand my experience and knowledge, and learn and create new things. When I'm not coding I'm usually outside exploring, running, photographing the world, or just enjoying the fresh air and sunshine !
